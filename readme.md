Based on the book dataset, a language model is trained to generate new book titles.

The language model is based on an embedding layer and a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) which, based on the previous set of characters, will generate a new character until it predicts the <END> special character, which represents that a title ends there.

The model has 3.7 million parameters.
